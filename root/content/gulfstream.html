        <h2>About the Gulf Stream</h2>
        <p>
            Recorded history and the impact of the “Gulf Stream” dates 
            to the original explorers of Columbus, Cabot and Ponce de 
            Leon in the late 15th century. As the Spanish Conquest radiated
            from the Caribbean, the “Great Current” became the established
            route for exploration and settlement. After the Spanish, the 
            British, French and Dutch used the stream to navigate the New
            World.
        </p>
        <p>
            Benjamin Franklin was the first to thoroughly analyze and map 
            the Gulf Stream during his travels as Ambassador to France 
            onboard U.S. mail ships bound for Europe. Using handheld devices 
            of his own design, he discovered the depth and temperature variations 
            which truly defined it as a “River in the Ocean.”
        </p>
        <p>    
            For over five centuries, the “The Blue God” has constantly served 
            sailors crossing the Atlantic and remains to this day a vital element
            of international commercial trade routes.
